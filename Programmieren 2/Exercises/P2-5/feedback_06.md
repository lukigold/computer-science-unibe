# Exercise 6 - Feedback

**1. Implementation of Crowning Logic**  
Your solution for the crowning logic seems to be working as intended, well done.


**2. Implementation of Jumping Logic**  
Your implementation for the jumping logic looks good as well.


**3. Testing**  
Looking at the exercise description, we have the following criteria that a piece/king must fulfill:
1. No piece or king can move off the board.
2. Pieces and kings can only move on dark squares (diagonally).
3. Only one piece or king can occupy a square.
4. Pieces can only move forward.
5. Pieces can jump over multiple opponents but only when moving forward.
6. Kings can jump forward and backward.
7. Kings can jump over multiple opponents both moving forward and backward.

Looking at your tests you have great coverage of the above cases. 
You also chose good names for the tests which makes it easy to identify what you are testing.


**4. General Notes** 
Overall I have the impression that your implementation is coming together nicely so far. 
Most classes are also well documented. Design by contract could however be improved which was rather sparse so far.

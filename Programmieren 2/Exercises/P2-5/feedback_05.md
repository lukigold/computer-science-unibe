# Exercise 5 - Feedback
*Sorry for the delay. The feedback is based on code / repo state from Monday, April 12th, so few things might have changed since.*

**1. Parser for game specification files**  
Parsing game specification files seems to work as intended, good job.

**2. Renderer to print game state**  
Prints the current game state to the standard output which is good.

**3. Movement of pieces**  
The initial movement of the pieces seems to work fine, well done.

**4. Tests for initial classes**  
You have initial tests for the `Parser` and `Renderer` classes as well as the movement of the pieces which is good.
There seems to be an issue regarding the renderer tests that need a fix though.

**5. Debugging Examples**  
You have provided great examples for debugging and seem to have good knowledge of it.

**6. UML Class Diagram**  
Your class diagram looks good and has a decent level of abstraction which is nice.
Next time, try to be more specific for the relations between the classes (regarding aggregation and composition).

**General Notes**  
- The "test" folder should be moved up one folder (into the "exercise_05" folder) and not be placed within the "src" folder.
  This also allows you to mark the "test" folder as a "Test Source Root" in an IDE like IntelliJ IDEA.  
  Try to adjust this (move "test" up into "exercise_05" folder) as you continue developing the game.

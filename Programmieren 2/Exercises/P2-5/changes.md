If we compare both UML with each other, some things changed. 

For one, The Piece class became more complex because the multiple jumping logic required more methods and editing existing ones.
In addition, the Move Command Class was added. This was mainly done to correctly detect wrong User Input in the Game main method.
The third big change was the implementation of the player class. This player class now represents a real player who interacts with his pieces in the game.
Other small changes such as adding coordinates to the board were also made.


All in all, the main structure in the UML didn't change all too much. Of course new classes and methods were added/edited because of the increasing
requirements, but a restructuring of the relations between the classes wasn't really needed. This shows that from the start we had a reasonable design
of the program to add new things in case of requirements changes.

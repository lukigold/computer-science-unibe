# Here are some Prototypes for our Checkers GUI



from the sketches we went a little further and then created the following examples in ![Photoshop](https://img.shields.io/badge/-white?style=flat-square&logo=Adobe-Photoshop) Adobe Photoshop.

#### simple GUI
![Checkers Gameplay v1](images/CheckersGameplay-v1.gif "animated version how the gameplay could look like." )
this GUI was created to be verry simple maybe we could go a little more simple with some simpler pieces.

#### Start Screen
![Checkers Start Screen](images/CheckersStartScreen.gif "animated version how the start menu could look like.")
This is  an animated version of how a start menu could look like. where the screen fades a new game would start,
with respect to what the user pressed. Playing with a friend in local ![Multiplayer](https://img.shields.io/badge/Multiplayer-401800),
or playing alone, in ![SinglePlayer](https://img.shields.io/badge/Singleplayer-401800), against a super intelligent
artificial intelligence would be possible. A ![How To Play](https://img.shields.io/badge/-How%20To%20Play-966239) button
could be added, that would lead to a website with a tutorial (*or a similar resource*).

#### Gameplay
![Checkers Gameplay v2](images/CheckersGameplay-v2.gif "animated version how the gameplay could look like.")
This is an animated version of how the game would be played. A user clicks on the piece to be moved, then on the place
where it should land, if the piece jumps over another piece, the jumped over piece would go to the side of the board and would still be visible.
We also could add a timer that would tick down from a given amount of time, and each player only has a certain amount of time to play,
but with a Timer we would also need a pause button and that would have to be implemented as well.

#### King
![Checkers King movement](images/CheckersGameplayKing.gif "animated version how the king can move." )
Here you can see how a piece would morph into a kings-piece. The king would be able to move diagonally in every direction.
With that in mind a kings piece can jump over multiple pieces in every direction. In the animation a king jumps over every
piece of the opponent and thereby wins the game. The game would then show the winner of the game and two buttons
![Rematch](https://img.shields.io/badge/-REMATCH-7c3a13) and ![MENU](https://img.shields.io/badge/-MENU-7c3a13) . The buttons
would be used to play a revenge or to go back to the main menu.

#### Phone GUI
![CheckersIPhone](images/CheckersIPhone.gif "animated Phone version of the game.")

To navigate on the board we would use a arrow like navigator, since the Checkers-board
would be fairly small and hence tapping on the fields would be stupidly annoying. The green navigator box would show,
where you are currently. Maybe the color could be adjusted to something more fitting, or we could change the navigator so that
a field where the navigator is at would change color slightly.

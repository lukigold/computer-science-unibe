# Here are some Prototypes for our Checkers GUI

### The first example would be hard to implement with the tools we know at the moment but if we wanted to go for style and design this would be the way to go.
#### collecting ideas for the main menu
![Sketch 1](Sketch1.png "first idea for a main menu." )
this sketch shows a concept of how a main menu could look like. The colored in squares represent a checkers board. 
#### first idea for the in game GUI
![Sketch 2](Sketch2.png "first idea for in-game look." )
we added a bar where players can see which players turn it is. The game would be played by pressing on the desired piece to be moved,
then pressing the spot where it should land. The Text field would also be handy to show if a move is out of bounds or just not possible.
Maybe an implementation where the stolen pieces would still be visible on the side would be nice.

### Based on the firs sketches we made some animations in ![Photoshop](https://img.shields.io/badge/-white?style=flat-square&logo=Adobe-Photoshop) Adobe Photoshop
#### simple gameplay only version of a GUI
![Checkers Gameplay v1](CheckersGameplay-v1.gif "animated version how the gameplay could look like." )
from this idea we went a little further and then created the following examples.
#### Start Screen
![Checkers Start Screen](CheckersStartScreen.gif "animated version how the start menu could look like.")
This is  an animated version of how a start menu could look like. where the screen fades a new game would start,
with respect to what the user pressed. Playing with a friend in local ![Multiplayer](https://img.shields.io/badge/Multiplayer-401800),
or playing alone, in ![SinglePlayer](https://img.shields.io/badge/Singleplayer-401800), against a super intelligent
artificial intelligence would be possible. A ![How To Play](https://img.shields.io/badge/-How%20To%20Play-966239) button
could be added, that would lead to a website with a tutorial (*or a similar resource*).

#### Gameplay
![Checkers Gameplay v2](CheckersGameplay-v2.gif "animated version how the gameplay could look like.")
This is an animated version of how the game would be played. A user clicks on the piece to be moved, then on the place
where it should land, if the piece jumps over another piece, the jumped over piece would go to the side of the board and would still be visible.
We also could add a timer that would tick down from a given amount of time, and each player only has a certain amount of time to play,
but with a Timer we would also need a pause button and that would have to be implemented as well.
#### King
![Checkers King movement](CheckersGameplayKing.gif "animated version how the king can move." )
Here you can see how a piece would morph into a kings-piece. The king would be able to move diagonally in every direction.
With that in mind a kings piece can jump over multiple pieces in every direction. In the animation a king jumps over every
piece of the opponent and thereby wins the game. The game would then show the winner of the game and two buttons
![Rematch](https://img.shields.io/badge/-REMATCH-7c3a13) and ![MENU](https://img.shields.io/badge/-MENU-7c3a13) . The buttons
would be used to play a revenge or to go back to the main menu.

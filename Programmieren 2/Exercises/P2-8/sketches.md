####collecting ideas for the main menu
![Sketch 1](images/Sketch1.png "first idea for a main menu." )
this sketch shows a concept of how a main menu could look like. The colored in squares represent a checkers board with pieces that would jump 
over and land on the selected gamemode.

#### first idea for the in game GUI
![Sketch 2](images/Sketch2.png "first idea for in-game look." )
we added a bar where players can see which players turn it is. The game would be played by pressing on the desired piece to be moved,
then pressing the spot where it should land. The Text field would also be handy to show if a move is out of bounds or just not possible.
Maybe an implementation where the stolen pieces would still be visible on the side would be nice.

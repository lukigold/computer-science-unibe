# Exercise 8

The last lecture covered *GUI Construction* and gave an introduction to GUI 
design.

In this week's exercise, we go back to pen and paper and learn how early GUI 
prototypes are sketched and designed. GUI mockups are dummies that are used to 
design a GUI and present some use cases without actually implementing program 
logic in the background. Initial mockups are often done with pen and paper, 
especially when designing a game interface. In addition, paper prototypes are 
used to simulate the user experience and get a first feeling on how the 
designed interface can be used.

In this exercise, you will draw mockups and create a prototype for the 
Checkers game. There is no programming involved in this exercises, but you 
should use the time in case you have unfinished business from the past 
exercises.

This exercise is an optional exercise. The groups who has passed all previous exercises, can skip this one.
On the other hand, the groups who has failed one exercise in the past, can not skip this and it is a chance to recover.

## GUI Design

Before implementing a GUI, it is often a good idea to first think about how 
the GUI should look like. The easiest way to do this is by sketching out your 
ideas with pen and paper. In this part of the exercise, you **do not need to 
implement anything**. Instead, we focus on bringing the ideas to paper. To 
pass this part, **you must complete the following tasks**:

- Create at least 6 different sketches for the main view of the Checkers game 
  (by main view we mean the state of a game where the player is playing the 
  game and moving around the board in an unsolved state). Draw your sketches
  by hand (on paper and preferably with a pencil; we do not accept drawings 
  that have crossed out and corrected parts!), take a photo or scan the 
  results, and add them to your repository. Your sketches can be similar, but 
  you should include at least three radically different designs. Among these
  sketches, one should be "playable" (with paper cutouts for player figures and
  walls).

- Select one of your sketches and create a paper prototype of your game. Simulate 
  the user experience by showing how the user interface can be used. Take a picture 
  of each (major) step. Your prototype should show the following:
  - Start screen.
  - Initial board state.
  - Performing a move with a piece/king (no jumping)
  - Performing a move with a piece/king (jumping over opponent)
  - Winning screen once a player has removed all opponent's pieces or blocked them
  - Whatever you intend to do after a game is played (is a rematch loaded? Are 
    you going back to the start screen? ...)

- Create a file `sketches.md` where you include the pictures for the 6 
  sketches you created before.

- Create a file `prototype.md`, where you include the pictures that show the 
  individual steps. For each picture, you should give a short description of 
  what it shows and what the user needs to do in order to get to the next one. 
  For example, you need to describe how the user can make the player move 
  around in order to solve the level.


## Notes

- Make sure that all your photos and/or scans are readable. If we can't read 
  them, we may ask you to redo them.

- Your designs can be intended for different devices. For example, you could 
  sketch a GUI for a smartphone or a console.

- Make sure you use proper markdown syntax in `sketches.md` and 
  `prototype.md`. If you are unsure about how to do that, read the [markdown 
  documentation](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/).

- Keep in mind that the GUI is not necessarily just about visualizing the 
  board. Maybe there is other useful information that you can present to the 
  user?
